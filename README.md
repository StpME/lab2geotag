# Narrative

This project is centered around the topic of climate change in the United States, using public discussions about the matter using tweets from Twitter to gauge public opinion and their beliefs. To narrow down these tweets, I searched for tweets that included climate change and global warming, using three US cities:
- Seattle, WA
- Houston, TX
- Oklahoma City, OK

I wanted to make this comparison to better understand how different states across the US perceive the issue. This data contextualizes the topic by seeing how different cities in different regions of the US talk about climate change and what is used to describe the matter as well.

## Analysis
Using Seattle as the baseline for a majority left-leaning cities, Houston as a Southern middle-ground state and Oklahoma City as a primarily right-leaning city, we can see the different ways and the amount that the topic of climate change is discussed online.
